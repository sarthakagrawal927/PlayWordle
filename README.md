For such situations one possible solution, once we have multiple final letters - we can try to eliminate the most common letters by using an entirely different word made with non selected characters.

Has failed for similar situation, so solution is needed. Try to fix 2 starting words maybe ?
Will it effect success probability ? will it increase/decrease the number of attempts ?
